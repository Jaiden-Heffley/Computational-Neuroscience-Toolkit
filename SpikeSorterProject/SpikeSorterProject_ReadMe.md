# SpikeSorterProject

## Overview

The **SpikeSorterProject** is a computational toolkit for sorting neural spikes using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering. The toolkit preprocesses waveform data, performs dimensionality reduction using PCA, and clusters the waveforms into distinct groups based on their principal components. This toolkit is useful for researchers working with spike sorting in electrophysiological data, providing an easy-to-use interface for analyzing spike waveforms.

## Features

- **PCA-based dimensionality reduction** to capture the most significant features of neural waveforms.
- **k-means clustering** to classify waveforms into distinct groups based on their projected principal components.
- **Visualization tools** for plotting clustering results and inspecting waveform separability.
- Ability to specify the number of clusters and customize analysis parameters.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
